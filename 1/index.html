      <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          I graduated from Miami University this year, majoring in interactive media studies. Instead of saying interactive, my major is more concentrated on media studies. However, I know media study is not the path I want to take in the future. I
          want to dive into the "interaction", the interaction between human and human, human and technology, and human and society. Experts have suggested that the average person thinks 60,000 to 80,000 thoughts every day, which equals 2,500 to
          3,000 every hour. Some of these are just passing thoughts that disappear quickly, and perhaps people don't even acknowledge them. I want to use the design tools to catch those ideas and make them come alive. Unlike other students who have a
          computer/design background, my design foundation is relatively weak. So, I want to concentrate on critical thinking about the design and transforming it into a design project.
          <br>The direction I want to approach is to use design as a medium to create an emotional link between each individual, to create a sense of empathy. Everyone is an independent individual; It is challenging to create an emotional link
          between them without any medium. From this perspective, I want to use my design as a medium/tool to arouse some emotional connections between individuals. I was in the news that happened recently in China. A graduate student of the Dalian
          University of Technology chose to commit suicide a week ago. The last straw that overwhelmed him was the heavy graduation pressure. This incident brought me a sense of empathy. At the same time, it also triggered my thinking. There are
          still many such things happening in society every day. If we have the opportunity to understand what they experience, whether we can avoid these things in the future? I believe that many people in the world are experiencing emotional
          fluctuations like him. I want to help them out, create a kind of emotional connection with them through my work, and let more people understand them. The more we understand them, the more likely we are able to help people who are
          experiencing the same pain as him in the future.
          <br>My target audience will be the people who are experiencing emotional pain; I want to provide them some new ways to help them adjust and release emotions. At the same time, I want to use my work to infect people with the same experience,
          create an emotional link between them, and evoke social empathy.
          <br>I was inspired by the artist called Doris Salcedo; Salcedo's work gives form to pain, trauma, and loss while creating a sense of empathy. Even though you don't know about her experience, you can feel her work. The quality Doris Salcedo
          has inspired me is how she uses her design to build an emotional bridge between the designer and audiences. She tries to use an artistic form to construct her work. I want to use a design form in my work to create an interactive medium to
          develop the concept of empathy.
          <br>My final goal here is to create a series of personal characteristics and develop them into a system. I want to become a designer, not a tool for design.

        <p >
          This 7 in 7 project helps me form a kind of design thinking as well as improves my ability to think independently. This is a thinking evolution process that we are continually thinking and producing every day, which helps us generally get used to looking at things from a design perspective. After criticizing, I found out I have lots of things that need to improve in the future. For this 7 in 7 post mortem, I will talk about my reflection throughout the entire project and what I plan to do for future projects.<br>
	To begin with, I want to talk about my reflection on these seven days projects. Finishing the idea with a prototype in a day can be very challenging. In order to follow a one-day rule, I didn't really take time to research and question myself about my design. My thinking process is very straightforward that after I come up with an idea, I will start to brainstorm the possible outcomes for this idea; sometimes, I may be able to think of two or three prototypes, sometimes I can only think of one. I did research some information about the idea concept I am trying to make, but I didn't show my research in my work. It is very important for designers to show the instance of their thinking process in their work because the audience needs to know why you want to start from that point and how you get that conclusion. I failed this part in many of the day's projects because I only showed the conclusion without the examples and references. For the project prototype, I didn't really take time to question myself why I chose that specific manifestation(for example, the post-it cards) as the form for my project. I decided to use that form just because I want to find a way to show my prototype and try to let the audience understand it. For example, in my day two project-record, I chose to use the box to record the mood reflection diary instead of a phone app or other expression forms. I was inspired by a design that uses a similar way of manipulating the story that positively affects the users. I think this can also be applied to this design. However, this kind of thinking needs to be avoided in design. This is exactly what a designer shouldn't do in their works because every design has different target users and purposes. Every step in the design process requires a lot of research and tests to make a conclusion on what is the most appropriate format for the project. To further develop this project, I will start by questioning why I want to make this physical? And after I have a reasonable conclusion on it, I will begin to do some survey about whether this kind of form can arouse people's interest, whether it can let users sit down every day to record through this physical method, and whether users can continuously use this product. After these steps, I can conclude that a physical manipulation method can be appropriate for this project.<br>
Another big problem I am facing right now is taking on a whole big problem all by yourself. For example, for day 3's work, I start with the conclusion that "By analyzing the reasons behind depression", I found that "many depression patients tend to be perfectionists", then I begin to expand my idea with it. Even though I did some research on depressed people that some of them tend to be perfectionists, I still cannot use that as my starting point. I am not depressed; I cannot define them from my point of view. I should talk with people who'd have gone through mental health issues like talking about their experience and identity—using their experience as the guideline for my project instead of my guesses about them. These are some of the mistakes I made in 7in7; maybe I can also call this a "learning process."
My intention changed in the middle; for the first three days, I am concentrating on using some tools/techniques to help a person alleviate their ongoing problems. However, from day 4, I focused on reflecting on emotion and using my work to communicate with a third audience. For example, on day 5's project about information explosion anxiety, I am not trying to solve the problem with this specific topic. I want to set up a scene to transform the virtual information into a kind of tangible information by using VR. Let the experiencer feel the anxiety of the information explosion in a more intuitive way. Because I don't have a clear intention in my work, I cannot convey my thoughts to the audience. So, trying to clarify what I am designing for is one of the most important things I want to figure out.
The project I like the most is day6's project -hide. I started with the emotion telling, that what kind of thing can tell our emotions. The journal called "Affective Eye Contact: An Integrative Review," written by Jari K. Hietanen pointed out that "The present review shows that there is accumulating evidence that eye contact automatically activates affective systems. Thus, it is likely that the affective processes and reactions also play a role in the various "eye contact effects" (Hietanen). I found out that the eye can be a powerful tool to help us reveal our emotions. Unlike the ears, eyebrows, nose, lips, we can read emotions just by looking at the eyes. Then I started to collect the image of the eye's emotions of different people, asking them to show emotions from their eyes. After collecting all the photos from my friends, I realize how easy it is to read emotions through people's eyes. I start to think about whether we really want other people to read our emotions through our eyes? If everyone can see through the other people's minds by merely observing their expressions, that will be scary. Then I choose to hide people's eyes from the image and make it a secret. I like this project because I can see the process of thinking in this project from my perspective. In the beginning, I only want to focus on the element that we can deliver emotions through the eyes. However, after observing the elements, I start to change my thinking direction and break some original rules of design. Even though this may not be a good project from other people's perspectives, from my perspective,  I can see the progress of the thinking process in this project. So I think this is my favorite project. This project reminds me of Behnaz Farahi's work named "CARESS OF THE GAZE". It is an interactive 3D printed wearable device that can detect other people's gaze and react accordingly with realistic behavior. It also reflects on the question that if our clothes can behave as artificial skin, we can change its shape and react with the outside world with emotional behavior, defining social issues such as intimacy, gender, and personal identity? Like the question I am raising in my project, if our clothing can react with the outside world, we will become transparent in front of other people. I think this is a fascinating and thought-provoking work and inspired me a lot.<br>
After finishing this 7 in 7 projects, I start to realize that focusing on the emotion-related problem is not the direction that I want to develop in my future project. Firstly, I don't have a clear path on what I want to do with the emotions. Because emotion is a pretty broad topic that can lead to many different directions, I cannot just say I want to make something related to the emotions. For example, Yuqing also focuses on emotion, but she has a clear direction on the human's dark side. For my project, some are focused on the depression for my work; some are focused on the release of emotions. Some are focused on the emotional expression, which is all related to the emotions but not really making some meaningful context with the concept. Secondly, I am not sure I am interested in this topic or not. I chose this topic as my personal statement motivation topic because I was affected by the news related to the social depression problem. I am a very emotional person; at that point, I really want to do some design to see if there is anything I can do to help people who are suffering the same pains. However, when I stepped into this topic, I realized that I am not standing in their points of view. I am standing in my perspective and doing some projects that I believe will help them to alleviate their ongoing problems. Because there is no depressed person around me, I don't have a chance to get close to them and talk with them.  Although I can learn more about them through constant data searching, I am not confident that I can make a design that can help them. So I decided to change my motivation direction for future projects.<br>
I don't have a clear direction on what I want to do for my future project. I do have some topics that I am interested in, for example, the reflection social phenomenon, Koren k-pop culture, but I don't know what I can develop with these topics. Almost every design can reflect on the social phenomenon problem that is not an excellent concept to stick with the project. Then I start to look at some contemporary artworks to draw some inspiration from it. After looking at some modern artworks, I found out an interesting common point——lots of the artwork all trying to "break the rules". Art is a way to help us to stretch and breakthrough boundaries with our own world vision freely. Most of the artworks do not follow the traditional way of drawing/thinking; they try to break the way we look at the world and follow their own rules. For example, a famous artist Marcel Duchamp's work-"Fountain." For D'uchamp, on the one hand, he wanted to use "Fountain" to crush the traditional aesthetic point of view. On the other hand, Duchamp signed "R.MUTT" on the work (the German word "poverty") to criticize the lack of imagination of artists at the time. His work breaks the boundary between "art" and "non-art". If the urinal is only regarded as a urinal, it will always be a daily necessity, but if you look at it from another dimension, it can also become a work of art. After researching, I started to question myself: Are there any rules that try to restrict me in my life? My answer is absolute, yes. Since I was young, my mom always told me that "Before crossing the road, please take a look at both sides. Don't talk to strangers. Don't talk during meals. Do your homework on time" All of these rules limit my life, but do I want to break them? I don't want to break these rules because there is no reason to violate the regulations just because you don't like them. So what kind of rules do I really want to break in my life? What I want to break is my mentality of pursuing social identity. We pay attention to what other people are doing and try to keep our behavior in line. Most of us always care about other people's feelings and will abandon our own unique identities to pursue others' sense of identity. If someone breaks one window of a house, more people will break other windows; everyone will think they are doing the right things because they are all doing the same behaviors. If people are in a spotless place, they will be embarrassed to throw garbage, but once there is garbage on the ground, people will throw it away without hesitation. We are trying to restrict ourselves with our own rules. Consider me as an example; personally, I really want to break this kind of social identity. When I try to make something, I would like to see other people's work first to make sure I do things right. I know there is no right or wrong answer to it, but I just want to make sure I am on the same path as other people. This kind of excessive pursuit of other people's identification may limit my own thinking. We can choose to follow the rules but sticking to the norms to be accepted by others is a different matter. I want to break this behavior of abandoning personal characteristics in the pursuit of social identity.<br>
Actually, I don't really know what I can do with that motivation because I don't have a big picture of it. Because I don't have a clear direction initially, it's challenging for me to sit down and think about what I really want to do for my project. Fortunately, major studio one is not asking us to make something professional. It's a class to help us figure out the direction. I am glad that I have a chance to try different approaches for my work, and I really hope at least one direction will fit my path. One thing I want to do next is to interview some of my friends and ask them about their experiences with social identity and how they think about social identity. Are they believe it is a thing they want to follow, or is it a thing they want to break in their life? Then maybe I can try to approach it from different perspectives, for example, how different cultures affect this kind of social identity and how it relates to our own personalities. The most challenging thing for me is to test out the possible manifestations of the topic. I don't really know how I can break the rules and what I can do with it. I hope to receive some suggestions from teachers and classmates. It will be beneficial if someone can provide me some direction on it. Actually, I feel so stressed these days because I am not familiar with these kinds of design paths that push me to develop something consistently. I don't really have time to sit down and think about what I want to do. It is very tough for me because I don't have so many experiences with it before and I don't know what I can do. But I am so glad I have a chance to reflect on my project and find out what I didn't do well. One of the biggest things I have learned from this project is trying to question yourself first. Asking questions and answers will be very helpful for us to develop our project. I hope I can cover these pressures and find out what I really want to do in the future.<br>

      <h1> Final Project Concepts</h1>

      <img src="../MindMap.jpg" alt="prototype1" width="1200" height="500">
      As I mentioned in my 7 in 7 Morten, I want to shift my concept from emotion to break the social identity. I started from that point; after the brainstorming discussion with my group member, I narrowed down the direction and found a better way to approach the concept, which can be defined as we or me. "We" can be defined as the society we live in, the groups related to us. "Me" can be defined as each individual, emphasis on yourself. If we flip "We" around, it will become "Me." When we are in a "WE" environment, "ME" may lose its identity. From this perspective, I came up with 5-6 concepts I want to develop for my final project.<br>
	Concept 1：Most people have a different identity online than they do in reality. They're willing to do what they want to do and say what they want to say online, but they're afraid to do it in real life. One of the reasons behind this phenomenon is because they don't want to be treated differently in the "we" environment. So they choose to hide "me" identity. From this perspective, I come up with two directions; first is something related to personal preference on the internet. Many people have their secret preferences, they like to share and watch them online, but they feel like it's a shame to tell people their secret preferences in real life. Which is to say, lots of people are trying to hide their true self on the internet and wearing masks in the real world. It is so close to our life and could happen to any of us. So I want to use this concept as one of my directions to show the double-side of our identity. <br>
	Concept 2: Under the "We" environment, we are losing our self-standard for judging things. I consider myself a prototype in this concept because I am a typical example. I don’t have a standard on what I am doing right or wrong, that all depends on how other people think about me.   I always try to do something with others in order to seek a sense of identity. When I try to do something new, I still want to ask others if they've done the same thing. If I am the only one that will make me feel like I am an outlier.But meanwhile, if someone said I did it right or gave me some positive feedback, I will have a sense of pride or joy.This is a significant conflict that we want to be heterogeneous and we like to get approval of others, but in order to get a sense of identity we will lose our self-principle from some extent. I want to make something to show this conflict in my design. <br>
	Concept3: When we put “Me” into “We”, “Me” will lose its identity. Just like a product in the assembly line that in order to pass a standard, everyone cuts himself/herself into the same shape. You might think that there is nothing wrong with it, because everyone is the same. But you are not yourself anymore, you can be anyone. Maybe some people want to avoid trouble because following other’s paths is easy. Someone just lacks self-identity they may not realize there is a problem with it. I want to reflect on common phenomena and maybe try to help people find their identity.Each of us is colorful, we all have different shapes, we need to know that.<br>
Concept 4:  When we are doing something different from others, we may even fall into self-doubt. Why? Have I done anything wrong? We may blame ourselves. Sometimes this kind of self-doubt and blame can lead to a positive outcome. Sometimes it will put you into a strange circle. I want to start from this point and try to reflect on this topic to see what I can do with it.<br>
Concept 5: Is that possible to still be "ME" under the "WE" situation? Trying to ignore others' eyes is kind of hard, but there are still lots of people trying to be themselves and explore their path. Showing individuality in a group must come at some cost, but it is always accompanied by innovation. From this perspective, I want to focus on being yourself, trying to make something that shows people's strong identification, and making it appealing and persuasive to other people. <br>
