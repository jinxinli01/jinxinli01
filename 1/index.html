      <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          I graduated from Miami University this year, majoring in interactive media studies. Instead of saying interactive, my major is more concentrated on media studies. However, I know media study is not the path I want to take in the future. I
          want to dive into the "interaction", the interaction between human and human, human and technology, and human and society. Experts have suggested that the average person thinks 60,000 to 80,000 thoughts every day, which equals 2,500 to
          3,000 every hour. Some of these are just passing thoughts that disappear quickly, and perhaps people don't even acknowledge them. I want to use the design tools to catch those ideas and make them come alive. Unlike other students who have a
          computer/design background, my design foundation is relatively weak. So, I want to concentrate on critical thinking about the design and transforming it into a design project.
          <br>The direction I want to approach is to use design as a medium to create an emotional link between each individual, to create a sense of empathy. Everyone is an independent individual; It is challenging to create an emotional link
          between them without any medium. From this perspective, I want to use my design as a medium/tool to arouse some emotional connections between individuals. I was in the news that happened recently in China. A graduate student of the Dalian
          University of Technology chose to commit suicide a week ago. The last straw that overwhelmed him was the heavy graduation pressure. This incident brought me a sense of empathy. At the same time, it also triggered my thinking. There are
          still many such things happening in society every day. If we have the opportunity to understand what they experience, whether we can avoid these things in the future? I believe that many people in the world are experiencing emotional
          fluctuations like him. I want to help them out, create a kind of emotional connection with them through my work, and let more people understand them. The more we understand them, the more likely we are able to help people who are
          experiencing the same pain as him in the future.
          <br>My target audience will be the people who are experiencing emotional pain; I want to provide them some new ways to help them adjust and release emotions. At the same time, I want to use my work to infect people with the same experience,
          create an emotional link between them, and evoke social empathy.
          <br>I was inspired by the artist called Doris Salcedo; Salcedo's work gives form to pain, trauma, and loss while creating a sense of empathy. Even though you don't know about her experience, you can feel her work. The quality Doris Salcedo
          has inspired me is how she uses her design to build an emotional bridge between the designer and audiences. She tries to use an artistic form to construct her work. I want to use a design form in my work to create an interactive medium to
          develop the concept of empathy.
          <br>My final goal here is to create a series of personal characteristics and develop them into a system. I want to become a designer, not a tool for design.

      As I mentioned in my 7 in 7 Morten, I want to shift my concept from emotion to break the social identity. I started from that point; after the brainstorming discussion with my group member, I narrowed down the direction and found a better way to approach the concept, which can be defined as we or me. "We" can be defined as the society we live in, the groups related to us. "Me" can be defined as each individual, emphasis on yourself. If we flip "We" around, it will become "Me." When we are in a "WE" environment, "ME" may lose its identity. From this perspective, I came up with 5-6 concepts I want to develop for my final project.<br>
	Concept 1：Most people have a different identity online than they do in reality. They're willing to do what they want to do and say what they want to say online, but they're afraid to do it in real life. One of the reasons behind this phenomenon is because they don't want to be treated differently in the "we" environment. So they choose to hide "me" identity. From this perspective, I come up with two directions; first is something related to personal preference on the internet. Many people have their secret preferences, they like to share and watch them online, but they feel like it's a shame to tell people their secret preferences in real life. Which is to say, lots of people are trying to hide their true self on the internet and wearing masks in the real world. It is so close to our life and could happen to any of us. So I want to use this concept as one of my directions to show the double-side of our identity. <br>
	Concept 2: Under the "We" environment, we are losing our self-standard for judging things. I consider myself a prototype in this concept because I am a typical example. I don’t have a standard on what I am doing right or wrong, that all depends on how other people think about me.   I always try to do something with others in order to seek a sense of identity. When I try to do something new, I still want to ask others if they've done the same thing. If I am the only one that will make me feel like I am an outlier.But meanwhile, if someone said I did it right or gave me some positive feedback, I will have a sense of pride or joy.This is a significant conflict that we want to be heterogeneous and we like to get approval of others, but in order to get a sense of identity we will lose our self-principle from some extent. I want to make something to show this conflict in my design. <br>
	Concept3: When we put “Me” into “We”, “Me” will lose its identity. Just like a product in the assembly line that in order to pass a standard, everyone cuts himself/herself into the same shape. You might think that there is nothing wrong with it, because everyone is the same. But you are not yourself anymore, you can be anyone. Maybe some people want to avoid trouble because following other’s paths is easy. Someone just lacks self-identity they may not realize there is a problem with it. I want to reflect on common phenomena and maybe try to help people find their identity.Each of us is colorful, we all have different shapes, we need to know that.<br>
Concept 4:  When we are doing something different from others, we may even fall into self-doubt. Why? Have I done anything wrong? We may blame ourselves. Sometimes this kind of self-doubt and blame can lead to a positive outcome. Sometimes it will put you into a strange circle. I want to start from this point and try to reflect on this topic to see what I can do with it.<br>
Concept 5: Is that possible to still be "ME" under the "WE" situation? Trying to ignore others' eyes is kind of hard, but there are still lots of people trying to be themselves and explore their path. Showing individuality in a group must come at some cost, but it is always accompanied by innovation. From this perspective, I want to focus on being yourself, trying to make something that shows people's strong identification, and making it appealing and persuasive to other people. <br>
