  I graduated from Miami University this year, majoring in interactive media studies. Instead of saying interactive, my major is more concentrated on media studies. However, I know media study is not the path I want to take in the future. I want to dive into the "interaction", the interaction between human and human, human and technology, and human and society. Experts have suggested that the average person thinks 60,000 to 80,000 thoughts every day, which equals 2,500 to 3,000 every hour. Some of these are just passing thoughts that disappear quickly, and perhaps people don't even acknowledge them. I want to use the design tools to catch those ideas and make them come alive. Unlike other students who have a computer/design background, my design foundation is relatively weak. So, I want to concentrate on critical thinking about the design and transforming it into a design project.
<br>The direction I want to approach is to use design as a medium to create an emotional link between each individual, to create a sense of empathy. Everyone is an independent individual; It is challenging to create an emotional link between them without any medium. From this perspective, I want to use my design as a medium/tool to arouse some emotional connections between individuals. I was in the news that happened recently in China.  A graduate student of the Dalian University of Technology chose to commit suicide a week ago. The last straw that overwhelmed him was the heavy graduation pressure. This incident brought me a sense of empathy. At the same time, it also triggered my thinking. There are still many such things happening in society every day. If we have the opportunity to understand what they experience, whether we can avoid these things in the future? I believe that many people in the world are experiencing emotional fluctuations like him. I want to help them out, create a kind of emotional connection with them through my work, and let more people understand them. The more we understand them, the more likely we are able to help people who are experiencing the same pain as him in the future. 
	<br>My target audience will be the people who are experiencing emotional pain; I want to provide them some new ways to help them adjust and release emotions. At the same time, I want to use my work to infect people with the same experience, create an emotional link between them, and evoke social empathy.
	<br>I was inspired by the artist called Doris Salcedo; Salcedo's work gives form to pain, trauma, and loss while creating a sense of empathy. Even though you don't know about her experience, you can feel her work. The quality Doris Salcedo has inspired me is how she uses her design to build an emotional bridge between the designer and audiences. She tries to use an artistic form to construct her work. I want to use a design form in my work to create an interactive medium to develop the concept of empathy.
	<br>My final goal here is to create a series of personal characteristics and develop them into a system. I want to become a designer, not a tool for design.

		<h3>Guding Questions</h3>
		<p> Dose the people who are experiencing frustration/depression willing to show their emotions to other people?<br>
		    Is there anyway to help them adjust their emotions?
			 </p>
			 
		<h3>Research</h3>
			 <p>
		 German psychologist Ursula Nubel pointed out in his book "Don't Fear Depression":
		A characteristic of all depression patients is that they try to hide behind the appearance of "all normal." <br>
		The immense ability of self-control and strong will still enable them to fulfill their daily obligations and requirements,<br>
		while leaving their illnesses to themselves and <b>not letting people around them notice.</b><br>
		Most people who are under depression are more likely to hide their emotions.
		There are three stages of depression: 
		The first stage is called denial, the second stage is called insomnia and the last stage is called disorder.<br>
		Denial is a kind of emotion that everyone may experience. For the second stage, reference people who fall into a state of depression for a long time, such as several weeks in a row.<br>
		For the third stage, it is a kind of danger that the body keeps the vital functions. Pathological processes occur in the human psychic sphere. <br>
		It is hard for me to come up with a solution to help the people who are in disorder; I am wondering there is anything I can do to help people from stage 1 and 2 and stop them from getting to the third stage.<br>
		For people with depression, what they need most is not an immediate solution to the problem, 
		but create a connection with their emotions. They need to find a way to express their true feelings.<br>
		However, is there a way that can help them to express their feeling without letting other people knows?
				 </p>
		 <h3>The idea</h3>
			 I am trying to find a way to let people express their emotions anytime without any limitation. I think the Post-it can be a suitable medium because it is easy to carry and use.<br>
			I want to make a transparent and disappearable post-it. In this way, the users can be used anywhere without being noticed. <br>
			 I will find some unique materials for the post-it to make sure it will not
			destroy the environment as well be able to disappear in a few days. I think the material like glutinous rice paper can be a good example. 
			 My goal here is to use the concept of "post-it" to create an emotional connection with the people in "bad mood" and provide them with a way to express their feelings. <br>
