      <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          I graduated from Miami University this year, majoring in interactive media studies. Instead of saying interactive, my major is more concentrated on media studies. However, I know media study is not the path I want to take in the future. I
          want to dive into the "interaction", the interaction between human and human, human and technology, and human and society. Experts have suggested that the average person thinks 60,000 to 80,000 thoughts every day, which equals 2,500 to
          3,000 every hour. Some of these are just passing thoughts that disappear quickly, and perhaps people don't even acknowledge them. I want to use the design tools to catch those ideas and make them come alive. Unlike other students who have a
          computer/design background, my design foundation is relatively weak. So, I want to concentrate on critical thinking about the design and transforming it into a design project.
          <br>The direction I want to approach is to use design as a medium to create an emotional link between each individual, to create a sense of empathy. Everyone is an independent individual; It is challenging to create an emotional link
          between them without any medium. From this perspective, I want to use my design as a medium/tool to arouse some emotional connections between individuals. I was in the news that happened recently in China. A graduate student of the Dalian
          University of Technology chose to commit suicide a week ago. The last straw that overwhelmed him was the heavy graduation pressure. This incident brought me a sense of empathy. At the same time, it also triggered my thinking. There are
          still many such things happening in society every day. If we have the opportunity to understand what they experience, whether we can avoid these things in the future? I believe that many people in the world are experiencing emotional
          fluctuations like him. I want to help them out, create a kind of emotional connection with them through my work, and let more people understand them. The more we understand them, the more likely we are able to help people who are
          experiencing the same pain as him in the future.
          <br>My target audience will be the people who are experiencing emotional pain; I want to provide them some new ways to help them adjust and release emotions. At the same time, I want to use my work to infect people with the same experience,
          create an emotional link between them, and evoke social empathy.
          <br>I was inspired by the artist called Doris Salcedo; Salcedo's work gives form to pain, trauma, and loss while creating a sense of empathy. Even though you don't know about her experience, you can feel her work. The quality Doris Salcedo
          has inspired me is how she uses her design to build an emotional bridge between the designer and audiences. She tries to use an artistic form to construct her work. I want to use a design form in my work to create an interactive medium to
          develop the concept of empathy.
          <br>My final goal here is to create a series of personal characteristics and develop them into a system. I want to become a designer, not a tool for design.
