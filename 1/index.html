      <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          I graduated from Miami University this year, majoring in interactive media studies. Instead of saying interactive, my major is more concentrated on media studies. However, I know media study is not the path I want to take in the future. I want to dive into the "interaction", the interaction between human and human, human and technology, and human and society. Experts have suggested that the average person thinks 60,000 to 80,000 thoughts every day, which equals 2,500 to 3,000 every hour. Some of these are just passing thoughts that disappear quickly, and perhaps people don't even acknowledge them. I want to use the design tools to catch those ideas and make them come alive. <br>
  	After a semester of study and exploration, I have re-established the direction I want to focus on in my future study. I want to use my design to tell my story. And use my design as a leading point and  let people engage in my design and create their own story with it. Seeing the design from the perspective of an experiencer itself and adding their own experiment into the design I want to use my story as the starting point and the experiencer’s story as the endpoint to create a design with a sense of participation. For my motivation of design, I want to let the experiencer to experience the design from their point of view. When the experiencer makes some action, they may don‘t have a chance to think about why they chose to do these kinds of behaviors because these actions are all their natural reaction under that kind of situation. .but afterwards they may start to think about why I choose to do this kind of behavior at that moment, and I believe everyone was able to get some unique self-reflection from their perspective.
    <br>
  	Because what I want to focus on can be considered as a sort of experimental design that the feedback from the experiencer is very important. During the experiment, we can't predict the reactions of the experiencer, and we can't intentionally manipulate the behavior of the experiencer, which is to say, the environment and workflow are very crucial. Consider my final project M/WE as an example. For the third prototype, I was setting a small scale scene in the class room and asking a couple of people who are familiar with my project to do the test. Under this kind of situation, even though I got some of the test results I wanted, these feedbacks were inaccurate. Although we cannot manipulate the participants' responses, we can try to eliminate factors that may lead to these errors. Personally, I really want to move my experiment out of the studio and put that into a public place. There is still a lot to learn and discuss around this field and I need to keep learning.
    <br>
  	Using the technology as the tool to improve my experience is my next goal.After the presentation, I did receive lots of good feedback from Sven that he provided me a new direction on how to use some technology to enrich my user experience. Although my abilities are very limited right now, I am willing to learn and understand these things and use them to help develop my ideas. At the beginning of the semester, I always think about what kind of technology I need to use to develop my ideas, but in fact these technologies are just tools to assist us. What we need at the beginning is to speak clearly about our ideas, and then use these things to enrich the ideas. I do have my whole idea now and what I should do here is trying to use these technologies to accomplish my goals. <br>
  	My target audience can be everyone; I want to hear their stories and transfer my design into their own design. . At the same time, I want to use my work to infect people with the sam
  e experience, create an emotional link between them, and evoke social empathy.
  <br>
   I want to become a designer, not a tool for design.
