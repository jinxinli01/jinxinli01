    <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>
    <p>
      Should we looking through the people's hearts by observing their expressions?
      what is the meaning of emotion?
    </p>

    <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
    <p>
    We all know that people's eyes can tell their emotions. When we talk with other people, eye contact will be very important for communication because we want to know other people's thoughts.<br> For example, for a good actor/actress we can always read their emotions through their eyes.<br> However, because they are performing for the audience, they are actually trying to hide their behind their acting.<br>

    </p>
    <h3>The idea</h3>
    The question is are we really want other people to read our emotions through our eyes?
    If you can see through the other people' minds by observing their expressions at all times, that will be so scary. 
    <h3>prototype</h3>

    <h3>Further development(maybe)</h3>
    <p>Not all people under depression want to hide their emotions; some people like to seek help from others but afraid to do so. <br>
      For the further development of this idea, I think I can create a post-it responding system for those people who are under depression. <br>
      For people with depression, what they need most is not an immediate solution to the problem,
      but create a connection with their emotions. They need to find a way to talk with other people<br>
      The people who post this "post-it" sticker can be the anonymous initiator, and people who have a chance to look at their post can be the emotional responder.
      This can be a different idea from the original one that it creates a new way of interaction. This is just a brief thought.<br>
    <p>
    <h3>To-do list</h3>
    <p>1. try to use the glutinous rice paper to create a post-it to test, to see whether it can be the medium of this work or not.<br>
      UPDATE:<br>
      <img src="../a.jpeg" alt="prototype1" width="300" height="400">
      <img src="../b.jpeg" alt="prototype2" width="300" height="400">
      <video width="320" height="240" controls>
        <source src="../c.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video><br>
      glutinous rice paper actually works and It will disappear when it touches water.It's not bad but I need to figure out how to make it more sticky.
      2. try to think more about the further development, how to make the interactive circle.
