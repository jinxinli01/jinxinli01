    <h3>Guidng Questions</h3>
    <div>

      </p>

      <a href="https://vimeo.com/embed/460908125" target="_blank">Sound Story</a>.
      <p>This design shows storytelling tool that provide children creative experience to create a story with sounds. I am wondering can I use this way to create a mood recorder tool to help people tells their daily stories? </p>
      <h3>idea</h3>
      I think every day is worth recording. Even a tiny thing may become a good memory in the future. Writing a diary has become a luxury for most of people today. People donâ€™t have time to sit at the table, write something about their daily
      lifes . So I wonder if we can make people record their daily moods in an interactive way,
      asking themselves a question every day. Transform everyday life into a memorable story. Memories are wonderful. I hope that when people are depressed, they can find good memories of the past.
      <h3>Prototyping</h3>

        <strong>Activities: recoring</strong><br>
        <strong>Enviroment: home</strong><br>
        <strong>interaction:Taking, playing, sitting, reflcting</strong><br>
        <strong>objects: table, chairs, mood boxes, smartphones, food/drink, music</strong><br>
        <strong>User: People who like to record their life, and create beautiful memories.</strong> <br>

      <P>There are several kind of box that represent the elements can be recorded. For the mood box, you can choose your mood for that day put into the hole, and the app will automaticlly record it. <br>
        For the music box, you can insert it and play, the system will change music everyday that you will have different choices for each day.<br>
        For the weather box, you can simply chose the weather for that day.<br>
        For the question box, you just need to roll a dice and put the box into the hole, and the app will tell you what question you need to answer for today, and once you plug the box into the machine the recoding function will automatic
        start to record and send it to the app.
        Your answer for each day will become your memory story.<br>
        The biggest problem here is how to make it look like a story. I am thinking right now is after a week, the app will combine your everyday answers together and make it a story.
        <br>tools: arduino, mobile phone app, boxes(wooden?), recorder
