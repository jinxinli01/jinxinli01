    <strong>     Introduction: </strong> <br>
    Conformity is when an individual displays a particular behavior because it is the behavior that the individual sees most frequently in others. Another explanation I preferred is “ A change  in behavior due to the real or imagined influence of other people.”[1]Conformity is usually motivated by an individual's identification with a specific group. At first, the group behaviors may differ from their own personal values. However, as time goes by, as the group's views and actions become entrenched, the individual's underlying beliefs and attitudes may begin to change. This research paper will discuss how conformity works in the individual and groups and the nature of conformity. <br>
 <strong>  Primary research-interview: </strong><br>
    	Influenced by my personal experience with the groups, I found that although most people like to think of themselves as unique individuals, the reality is that when individuals come to a group, they are more likely to "follow the crowd. " This behavior could be called conformity. To prove that I am not alone in this sense of conformity, I asked 5-6 random students in my class, "Do you tend to be influenced by other people's decisions in a group, do you care about other people's opinions in a group, and have you ever changed your opinion in a group in order to get the approval of others? Most of the interviewees had similar experiences with conformity,  one of the interviewees said that she cared a lot about other people's opinions, but would only take it as advice and not follow it blindly unless they were people she considered to be in authority.

   <strong>  The Asch Conformity Experiments：</strong><br>

  In The Asch Conformity Experiments[2], Asch(1955) asks seven to nine psychology students to participate in a visual judgment task. Each student will have two cards, one with a standard line and the other with three test lines. Each student needs to tell, in front of the rest of the group, which of the three test lines is the same as the standard line. Expect one student, all of the other students were lab associates who gave obviously wrong answers to guide the participating students. There were 18 different trials in the experimental condition, and 12 of the confederates gave incorrect answers, which Asch called "crucial trials". The purpose of these key trials was to see if participants would change their answers to match others' responses in the group. Under ordinary circumstances, individuals made mistakes less than 1 percent of the time, but under group pressure, the subjects accepted the wrong judgments in 35.8 percent of the case(.Asch, S. E. (1955)" [3]
So, what do the results of the Asch consistency experiment show? At the end of the experiment, participants were asked why they went with the others. Most students said that although they knew the other group members were wrong, they did not want to risk being ridiculed. Some participants suggested that they believed that the other members of the group were correct in their responses. [4] This kind of conformity seems like not unconscious conformity. They had a clear answer in mind but chose to go along with it rather than be special. So is conformity an instinctive and unconscious performance, or is it conscious obedience in the group?
