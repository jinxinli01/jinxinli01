<strong>Who are you?<br></strong>
After the critic, I just realized instead of expect the experiencer to do something follows my imagination,I hope to use something to lead the experiencer instead of limit them. So I want to create a experience which let the experiencer to find their real shadow. By changing the light and other people's position to affect experiencersâ€™awareness. After the digital prototype, I found out that translucent materials can be a good form to show shadows. This remind me of a kind of paper called shoji paper. I plan to do some test with it to see how it works under the real situation. Because of the setting limitation I start with a small scale prototype.<br>
Setting:<br>
  <img src="../prepare.jpeg" alt="prototype1" width="800" height="500"><br>

Testing:<br>

The material is very light-transmitting, and there are no shadows at all if there is no light on that side. I can manipulate the light to make the audience fall into the scene.<br>

If there are more than one light sources from one side, one single person can create multiple shadows at the same time.<br>

If the lighting from both sides and there are people in both sides the shadow can blend well together. But the requirements for lighting and position are quite high.
Here is another testing with the different lighting, we can see that it doesn't work well in this setting.<br>

Overall, the literation tests works ok for me, and looks much better than the prototype I had before.The goal here is by changing the lights and shadows to create a sense of being lost in his/her own and other people's shadow. However, there are still lots of problems need to be solve.
2.How to improve the quality of the experience can be the biggest problem. <br>
I am stuck here right now and don't know what should I do it next....
