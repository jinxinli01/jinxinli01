    <h2>DAY1- disappearable post-it</h2>
      </div>
  <div class="project">
    <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>
    <p> Dose the people who are experiencing frustration/depression willing to show their emotions to other people?<br>
      Is there anyway to help them release their emotions?
    </p>

    <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
    <p>
      Everyone will face lots setbacks, pressures and difficulties in life. Lots of people will bury these pressures under their hearts.<br>
      However, hiding it is not a good choice that this kind of emotion will accumulate and eventually develop into depression. What we need to do is get bad emotions/things
      out of the chest and release the emotion stuck in your body. Emotions need to be expressed to be processed. <br>
      One of the best forms of emotional healingâ€”write it down. When we write, we give a voice to the inner world. We deal with and understand what is happening inside and around us.
      We gain perspective; by writing about our fears and hurts, we can look at them from a distance, get rid of them, and finally let go of them.
      Writing can be a good form.


    </p>
    <h3>The idea</h3>
    I am trying to find a way to let people express their emotions anytime without any limitation. I think the Post-it can be a suitable medium because it is easy to carry and use.<br>
    I want to make a transparent and disappearable post-it.<b>Disappearable</b> is my main concept idea for this project.
    The reason why I think this post-it sticker should be disappearable because I hope the people who are using this sticker can get over their bad emotions and let is disappear. Also I believe the people who wants to use sticker don't want
    other people to notice their
    post-it sticker, so this function can help can let them release their emotions more freely.
    want this to be last for a long time that In this way, the people can be used anywhere without being noticed. <br>
    I will find some unique materials for the post-it to make sure it will not
    destroy the environment as well be able to disappear in a few days. I think the material like glutinous rice paper can be a good example.
    My goal here is to use the concept of "post-it" to create an emotional connection with the people in "bad mood" and provide them with a way to express their feelings. <br>

    <h3>prototype</h3>

    <img src="../prototye.jpg" alt="prototype2" width="300" height="400">


    <h3>Further development(maybe)</h3>
    <p>Not all people under depression want to hide their emotions; some people like to seek help from others but afraid to do so. <br>
      For the further development of this idea, I think I can create a post-it responding system for those people who are under depression. <br>
      For people with depression, what they need most is not an immediate solution to the problem,
      but create a connection with their emotions. They need to find a way to talk with other people<br>
      The people who post this "post-it" sticker can be the anonymous initiator, and people who have a chance to look at their post can be the emotional responder.
      This can be a different idea from the original one that it creates a new way of interaction. This is just a brief thought.<br>
    <p>
    <h3>To-do list</h3>
    <p>1. try to use the glutinous rice paper to create a post-it to test, to see whether it can be the medium of this work or not.<br>
      UPDATE:<br>
      <img src="../a.jpeg" alt="prototype1" width="300" height="400">
      <img src="../b.jpeg" alt="prototype2" width="300" height="400">
      <video width="320" height="240" controls>
        <source src="../c.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video><br>
      glutinous rice paper actually works and It will disappear when it touches water.It's not bad but I need to figure out how to make it more sticky.
      2. try to think more about the further development, how to make the interactive circle.
