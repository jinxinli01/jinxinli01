starting point:<br>
      <img src="../sketch1.png" alt="prototype1" width="1020" height="800"><br>
After classroom discussions and after-school conversations with classmates and teachers, I decided to use my first sketch as the direction and starting point for my final project. As I mentioned in my research story for my final project, I want to put individual/myself into the work to reflect on the concept instead of demonstrating the direct meaning behind the comformity itself. As my storyboard shows, at the beginning, I want to set a screen in a dark room to show other people's behavior, and when I enter the room, I will start to follow the screen people's behavior. And on the top there is a projector that can reflect my shadow with a different movement. For this conceptï¼ŒI consider myself as the marionette hanging by a virtual thread while I am trying to imitate others. The shadow with different movement reflects my real thoughts. However, there are some technical and logical problems with this idea. Firstly, It is hard for the projector to reflect the different behavior shadow without seeing your real shadow. Secondly, It is hard to create virtual lines with the projector to track your behaviors. Also, there is a logical problem that when the people enter the room, how do they know that the shadows reflected on the floor are their shadows? Due to these problems, I start to think deeper about how can I use shadow to create a more persuasive and experiential experience to show the conformity?
